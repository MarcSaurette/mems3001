# Hypothes.is\*

â€‹[Hypothes.is ](https://hypothes.is/)is a tool which allows you to annotate web content for your personal research use or, in our case, to allow us to collaborate as a group. It is, in essence, a digital version of you writing notes in the margins of a book/ photocopy. If you open a pdf in your browser, for example, you can annotate it and all your comments are saved in a central location.

{% hint style="info" %}
The following are instructions for using hypothesis on a laptop/desktop.&#x20;

If you are using hypothes.is on a mobile device/ tablet, read their suggestions for best practices: [https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-use-hypothesis-on-mobile-devices/](https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-use-hypothesis-on-mobile-devices/)

It is also possible to use hypothes.is via Chrome to annotate pdfs on your local hard drive: [https://web.hypothes.is/help/annotating-locally-saved-pdfs/](https://web.hypothes.is/help/annotating-locally-saved-pdfs/)
{% endhint %}

### Quick start:

Click[ this link](https://hypothes.is/groups/LKiykDpj/mems3001-2023) to join the class hypothes.is group and register for an account.&#x20;

### Installing Hypothes.is

We will use hypothes.is _via_ a plug-in for Chrome or a Bookmarklet on other browsers.

1. If you don't already use Google Chrome, download a free copy [here](https://www.google.ca/chrome/) and install. The hypothes.is extension used to only works for Chrome, but now they give you other options. Chrome is still the most stable...

2\.  Navigate to the hypothes.is website ([https://web.hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/)) and press the "Get Started" button in the top right corner.&#x20;

3\. If you click on the "Get Started" button it will take you to page to sign up for an account and a link to download the Chrome extension.&#x20;

4\. First navigate to the account sign up. You can use any email and password. Just make sure to remember them both (even better, write them down somewhere safe). And then add your username to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13qCBEz-SuqnpS4KTj55guhPZ2Wr1dLi53RV-5BN87pA/edit?usp=sharing). Afterwards click[ this link](https://hypothes.is/groups/LKiykDpj/mems3001-2023) to join the class hypothes.is group.

5\. Go back to the previous page ([https://web.hypothes.is/start/](https://web.hypothes.is/start/)) and click to download the google chrome extension. Install it as your system requires.&#x20;

6\. If you need to reopen Chrome after installing the hypothes.is extensions, do so and navigate to any webpage. You should now find the hypothes.is icon on your browser. You can click on the icon to start it up hypothes.is. To be a bit _meta_, I'm using hypothesis to comment on these hypothesis instructions...

7\. You will need to sign into hypothesis. After clicking on the hypothesis icon once, (1) click on the sign up/Log in option on the top right corner. Add your username and password. Then go over to the "currently viewing" drop down menu (2) on the top left of the hypothesis sidebar and select "MEMS 2001 - 2023". If this is not offered as an option, make sure you have clicked on[ this link](https://hypothes.is/groups/LKiykDpj/mems3001-2023) to join the class hypothes.is group and try again. This is super important. We want you to post in a goup that we can find and that other (non-class) people don't see publicly (which is the default).

8\. When you select text with your mouse/cursor, Hypothesis will give you the opportunity to "annotate" or "highlight". You should normally choose to annotate.&#x20;

9\. When you click on annotate a sidebar will open (or perhaps it was already open) which notes both the text your selected and gives you an opportunity to make a comment about it. If you are making notes smartly, you will rephrase the text, or explain its significance or note a question. Essentially, you should interact with the idea that you think is significant, so that you remember it.&#x20;

10\. You should add some tags as well. If you are doing research and you are exploring different interrelated topics, it is very useful to create tags to help future-you find these annotations and your ideas again. The key is consistency, so Hypothes.is stores a library of your tags. If you click on a tag, it takes you to a list of all the other uses of that tag in your annotations.&#x20;

11\. After you have entered your text be sure to press the "Post to ..." button, which makes the text available for others to see. And now the post looks complete. If you do want to go back to edit the annotation, click on the pencil icon at the bottom right corner&#x20;

\[pencil=edit| garbage = delete| left arrow = reply to the annotation| upward arrow = share]

12\. Now play around with Hypothes.is. You might also want to make a separate private folder for comments you want to keep to yourself (or for each research project you are working on this year...).&#x20;
