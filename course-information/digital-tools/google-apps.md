# Google Apps

For collaborative work, google apps (docs, sheets, calendar) are convenient, free, easy to use and powerful enough for most of our needs. We will use as required, but for the most part I will ask you to use google sheets, for example, to sign up for different things, so you won't need to have a google account for the most part.&#x20;

And we'll work together on a jointly written Proposal (and curatorial statement) for our group project.&#x20;

The initial template for the proposal can be consulted [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ErfaEmOOA55HDt7gKiXcACTWdZmN02O8x6z79ppFW\_8/edit?usp=sharing):&#x20;
