# Office

Office 365 is Microsoft's subscription-based enterprise tools package. You'll find that you might want to use all or maybe only a few of these in class this year. Certain of these tools are a standard that you might use throughout university and in later jobs,, such as Word for word processing, Excel for spreadsheets, Outlook for mail/scheduling etc. Others, like Teams and Whiteboard are relatively new products that might stick around or might not.

You may already have Office 365 installed on your computer using a non-Carleton ID. You will need to make sure that you are signed into Office with your CMAIL account in order to take advantage of its integration with Microsoft Teams which we will be using to communicate by text or videoconferencing.

For our class, we are going to use Microsoft Teams, so be sure to download it also, install it and test it out before class starts.

You may have already installed Microsoft Office before arriving at Carleton. It is important that you authenticate with Microsoft with your Carleton email even so, because many tools for collaborating in class (such as Teams) only work with people who belong to our institution.

If you need help with installing any Microsoft tools, you can consult the ITS [help page](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-installing-office-35ff2def-e0b2-4dac-9784-4cf212c1f6c2?ui=en-US\&rs=en-US\&ad=US) or (easier) get in touch with the ITS (Information Technology Services) [help desk](https://carleton.ca/its/contact/).[Course Information - PreviousDigital Tools](https://marc-saurette.gitbook.io/gaming-the-middle-ages/course-info/digital-tools)[NextTeams](https://marc-saurette.gitbook.io/gaming-the-middle-ages/course-info/digital-tools/teams)
