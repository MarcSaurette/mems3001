[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a powerful tool for taking notes and organizing knowledge. As they say:

> _Everything is connected_
>
> The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same. __ In Obsidian, making and following connections is frictionless. Tend to your notes like a gardener; at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph.

They are happy to describe what it is and what it is good for. We agree: it's benefits are:

1. it allows you to connect information easily and visual those connections
2. it can be used simply or in very complex ways - it has a community of developpers who keep expanding what it can do
3. it is future proof - it is easy to keep ownership of your information and you can easily export out information if you want to stop using it.&#x20;

To get a sense of what Obsidian does and how you can use it, take a look at their resources page: [https://www.obsidianroundup.org/resources/](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/resources/)

At the end of term, students will be expected to submit their entire Obsidian vault to show how it was used throughout term (i.e. to show whether the student made use of the medium above expectation).&#x20;

* our goal, if everyone agrees, will also be to create a communal vault, linking people's work together and establishing a shareable repository of everyone's work in a new Obsidian vault.&#x20;
