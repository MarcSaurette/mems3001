[Mindmeister](https://www.mindmeister.com/?r=976984) is a web-based interface to allow project planning or brainstorming to happen collaboratively. I feel like it might be a good place for us to share ideas or make mindmaps to keep us on track. It offers a good tool for visualizing ideas and knowledge, which some people (like myself) find very helpful.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Mindmeister allows you three (3) free maps in its basic (free) service. If you sign up for an account via this [link](https://www.mindmeister.com/?r=976984) it gives me an additional map I can see (which is important if you want me to see a map you create).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

I have started two planning maps that students can contribute to once you're signed up. Consider both very much _in progress_. You can see them via the links below:
