# Folio Measurements

### Goals:&#x20;

* start to work with medieval material, even before we are able to read or understand what their purpose.&#x20;
* this is the first step in creating a handmade reproduction of the folio
* to understand the page layout of a medieval manuscript folio or early printed work
* to take precise measurements of the page layout, so that you will be able to reproduce the page later

### Requirements:

* Soft rulers (with mm's)
* phone/camera for taking reference shots of folios
* ScanTent (provided by professor)
* Size reference card ([https://smallpond.ca/jim/scale/printing.html](https://smallpond.ca/jim/scale/printing.html))
* Colour reference card&#x20;
* paper and pencil (NO PENS!) for writing down notes, sketching out

### What to measure?

{% hint style="info" %}
All measurements should be taken in mm's
{% endhint %}

Medieval manuscript layout followed a regular format, based on an ideal of proportion. Your goal is to try to measure aspects of the layout, in order to reproduce the proportions. &#x20;

![Fig .1. Proportions of a bifolium](../../.gitbook/assets/Golden-section-a.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Bifolium**_\
\- a _sheet_ folded in the middle so as to form two leaves (_folia_); each leaf has two sides.

The two leaves are _conjoint_ or _conjugate_ leaves (each being the conjoint or conjugate leaf of the other); they are respectively the anterior and the posterior leaf.\
A convenient way of mentioning e.g. ‘ff. 26 and 29, that are conjoint’ is to print ‘ff. 26^29’.
{% endhint %}

Your goal to prepare for your reconstruction of a folio facsimile is by taking measurements of the writing space, compared to the size of the folio, and all the lines within and without, using the following templates for reference:

![Fig. 2](<../../.gitbook/assets/Fig. 35.6b.png>)

![Fig 3.](<../../.gitbook/assets/Fig. 35.6a.png>)

Record, in millimetres, measurements of all of the following (in reference to figures 2 & 3). In medieval manuscripts, the lines (i.e. ruling) are present, but these disappear from print texts. If you are working with a print work, approximate these measurements as much as possible; you will have to do the same with some medieval folios with particularly decorative borders.

* writing frame (STUV)
* frame lines (ST, UV, SU, TV)
* top line (ST)
* bottom line (UV)
* bounding lines (SU, TV)
* intercolumnar lines (C, D, E)
* occasional intercolumnar (P, Q)
* marginal lines (KL + H + MN)
* pricking (x, y) - _medieval folios only (see next section)_

With reference for figure 1, record the following:

* ab
* ae (if bifolium)/ af (if single folio)
* fg & gc (compare to ab)
* ah
* bi
* kf

### Recording ruling patterns

{% hint style="info" %}
This section does not apply if you are working on print material. Pricking and ruling is one of the technologies of the book that falls by the wayside with the advent of printing, since type obviates the need for lines on the page for the scribe to fill.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Every medieval folio in our collection has a different ruling pattern, so the schematics (fig. 2 & 3) above will not account for every example – especially those containing music or images. Prickings are just very small holes that have been made with an awl or penknife on either side of a bifolium. These offer guides for the scribe to draw lines with a straightedge, record therefore as many prickings as you can find, and locate them&#x20;

* X prickings (horizontal) - measured from fold/inner margin outwards.&#x20;
* Y prickings (vertical) - measured from top of folio down

From a fixed reference point (usually the top of the outside margin), you will also need to observe and measure space used for:

* &#x20;initials (usually extending slightly into the margin outside the writing frame)
* decoration, and&#x20;
* musical staff (length, number of lines, interlinear spacing, distance from text, size of notes)

Also record whether lines are ruled in lead/graphite, ink or blind ruled (i.e. a hardpoint leaving an impression).&#x20;

Often folios will be trimmed or resized after being bound/rebound. Prickings will regularly be cut off at the outer margin of folios (top, bottom and outer) for aesthetic reasons. There may be pricking that survives in the inner margin if each folio (as opposed to a bifolium) is ruled individually. Usually however (as the two examples below indicate) a single side of a bifolium (i.e. two pages) is ruled at once.&#x20;
