# Folio Measurements

### Goals:&#x20;

* to understand the page layout of a medieval manuscript folio or early printed work
* to take precise measurements of the page layout, so that you will be able to reproduce the page later

### Requirements:

* Soft rulers (with mm's)
* phone/camera for taking reference shots of folios
* ScanTent (provided by professor)
* Size reference card ([https://smallpond.ca/jim/scale/printing.html](https://smallpond.ca/jim/scale/printing.html))
* Colour reference card&#x20;
* paper and pencil (NO PENS!) for writing down notes, sketching out

### Stages

{% hint style="info" %}
All measurements should be taken in mm's
{% endhint %}

Medieval manuscript layout followed a regular format, based on an ideal of proportion. Your goal is to try to measure this&#x20;

![Fig .1. Proportions of a bifolium](../../.gitbook/assets/Golden-section-a.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Bifolium**_\
\- a _sheet_ folded in the middle so as to form two leaves (_folia_); each leaf has two sides.

The two leaves are _conjoint_ or _conjugate_ leaves (each being the conjoint or conjugate leaf of the other); they are respectively the anterior and the posterior leaf.\
A convenient way of mentioning e.g. ‘ff. 26 and 29, that are conjoint’ is to print ‘ff. 26^29’.
{% endhint %}

Your goal to prepare for your reconstruction of a folio facsimile is by taking measurements of the writing space, compared to the size of the folio, and all the lines within and without, using the following templates for reference:

![Fig. 2](<../../.gitbook/assets/Fig. 35.6b.png>)

![Fig 3.](<../../.gitbook/assets/Fig. 35.6a.png>)

Record, in millimetres, measurements of all of the following (in reference to figures 2 & 3):

* writing frame (STUV)
* frame lines (ST, UV, SU, TV)
* top line (ST)
* bottom line (UV)
* bounding lines (SU, TV)
* intercolumnar lines (C, D, E)
* occasional intercolumnar (P, Q)
* marginal lines (KL + H + MN)
* pricking (x, y)

With reference for figure 1, record the following:

* ab
* ae (if bifolium)/ af (if single folio)
* fg & gc (compare to ab)
* ah
* bi
* kf

Not pictured but necessary to measure (if relevant)

* space allotted for initials, decorative space,&#x20;
* musical lines (length, number, interlinear spacing, distance from text)
