Digitized Manuscript Project (with well developed prose description)

* Look at the Codex Gigas itself, but pay more attention to the codicological description offered (palaeography, illustration....). Start here: [http://www.kb.se/codex-gigas/eng/short/](http://www.kb.se/codex-gigas/eng/short/)

Working with Fragments:

* Lost Manuscripts: pilot project to build catalogue for fragments. [About](http://www.lostmss.org.uk/project), [Terminology](http://www.lostmss.org.uk/project/how-use-site/terminology-fragments), [Sample Fragment](http://www.lostmss.org.uk/highlights/letters-law)​
* ​[Fragmentarium](https://fragmentarium.ms/): another pilot project. [Case Studies](https://fragmentarium.ms/about/case\_studies), [Timeline](https://fragmentarium.ms/about/digital-library)​
* First issue of the [Fragmentarium journal](http://fragmentology.ms/issues/1-2018/). Read one article to see how scholars use fragments as part of a larger historical question.\
