You should try to record, in millimetres, measurements of all of the following (in reference to the above diagrams):

* writing frame (STUV)
* frame lines (ST, UV, SU, TV)
* top line (ST)
* bottom line (UV)
* bounding lines (SU, TV)
* intercolumnar lines (C, D, E)
* occasional intercolumnar (P, Q)
* marginal lines (KL + H + MN)
* pricking (x, y)

Not pictured but necessary to measure (if relevant)

* space allotted for initials, decorative space,&#x20;
* musical lines (length, number, interlinear spacing, distance from text
