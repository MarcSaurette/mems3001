# Pictures and Manuscripts\*

How to take pictures and use them of medieval manuscripts (incomplete and utterly in progress)

#### Take pictures with Capturing the Past:

> Apply consistent machine readable file naming to photographs of historic documents and log the capture process to support the users of those photos!
>
> The purpose of the Capturing the Past phone app is to apply consistent machine readable file naming to photographs of historic documents and log the capture process in a comma separated value file to support the users of those photos. The app uses the device’s camera and saves photos with catalogue reference information included in the filename.
>
> The app’s reference generation mimics the reference numbers used in the The National Archives’ Discovery Catalogue and includes timestamps so that unlimited versions of each photo/reference can coexist and be ordered according to when they were taken. The result is a photo named to identify a specific item in a internationally identifiable archive catalogue (or user assignable variation if no Archon code is available).
