# 1. Quill Making

Writing on paper and parchment requires a writing instrument. Pens, made from reeds or quills, would be used and could be customized for its intended purpose (a few flicks of a knife would change the nib from fine point to broad edge). The two main tools of a scribe were thus the penknife (a multi-purpose tool meant for cutting pages, pricking for ruling, sharpening quills and erasing mistakes) and the quill pen for writing. In the following image, notice the grip and how the writing surface is not flat, but angled (at about 45Â°).

Our goal for this exercise, is to make a quill pen and try to reproduce the pen strokes necessary to make a medieval bookhand. Our exercise has two stages: pen making and pen trials. It takes a bit of practice to do either, so don't get frustrated!

* any kind of long bird feather - swan or goose feathers work best (if not able to get any, plastic straws can also work in a pinch).
* very sharp knife/ cutting mat
* electric iron/ bowl of heated sand (not obligatory)

Instead of working up a tutorial from scratch, I will point you to the [excellent tutorial produced by Sara Charles](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1103968226835337217.html), on quill making. Also, bonus, pictures include cats. The linked instructions provide a very detailed step-by-step, but you can skip one or two steps:

* given we might only be using the pens for a few trials, you might not need to heat-harden them
* I'm not sure how important it is to remove the waxy coating on the exterior of the feather bottom
* you might not need to remove the upper feather bits (medieval scribes made the quills smooth, so unlike in period pieces, there wouldn't be the feathery bits, but it might make too much of a mess to remove them)

After you have made the quill, try writing with some ink on the parchment scraps in the Book Arts lab, if possible, using the writing models presented in David Harris' _The Art of Calligraphy_ (posted on Perusall)_._
