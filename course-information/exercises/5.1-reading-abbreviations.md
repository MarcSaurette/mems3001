# 5.1 Reading abbreviations\*

### Overview

* Recognizing medieval letter forms is one thing, being able to recognize words and sentences is another. In this class, we will consider how medieval scribes abbreviated words (according to a discernable system), and used punctuation in ways very different (but foundational) to ours.
* Abbreviations, punctuation, symbols etc. are part of a developing technology of the book. Consider the digital side to this,&#x20;
* In this class we will begin to try to read medieval scripts and make sense of the texts

* Adriano Capelli's now very old text _Abbreviationes_ remains the reference work of record. Luckily it has been semi-translated, updated and made more accessible. Read the intro to Capelli laying out a theory of medieval abbreviation, translated into English [here](https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/1821/47cappelli.pdf).
* Use Capelli through a browser [here](https://www.adfontes.uzh.ch/mobile/#CappelliSeite) (unfortunately the interface is only in French or German at this point). The searchable version for a browser on a computer is [here](https://www.adfontes.uzh.ch). A digitized copy of the print version can be read on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/LexiconAbbreviaturarum).

### Goals:

* to understand how and why medieval scribes systematically emplyed abbreviations
* to understand how and why abbreviations (and punctuation) affect how we read and can express ourselves in text

### Requirements:

* Laptop with medieval fonts installed

To do:

In preparing for the class in week 7, I want you to think about the method behind the madness of modern abbreviations. We'll be making a list of commonly used abbreviations (that you all use today)
