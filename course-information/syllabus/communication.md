# Communication

### The short answer

Come talk to me. Talk to me after class and come visit me during office hours.&#x20;

Otherwise, all communication outside the classroom should happen via the [Teams](broken-reference) platform. We can message privately, post general messages to channels, we can meet in an audio or videoconference as a whole or in small groups/ one-on-one.

Only rarely should you email me (the professor) because it'll likely get caught in an email backlog.&#x20;
