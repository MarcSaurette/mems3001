This syllabus represents a plan, a hope, a goal. It describes the scope of knowledge that we will cover and the different things students need to do to learn and to integrate their knowledge. It is written as if we are able to come to campus in person. But this might change, and thus so might what we cover and what we can expect from one another. The assignments are designed to be flexible and able to be accomplished at a distance, if need be. I am a firm believer in the paramount importance of personal connection between professor and learners and between students themselves, so if we canâ€™t do this in person, the course will seek to accomplish this digitally.
