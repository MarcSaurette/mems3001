# Process Letter

At the end of the term, students will be asked to submit a written (750 word) critical self-evaluation (_critical_ in the sense of "using logic and evidence to argue"), describing their learning and how their work evolved over the year. This document is not worth marks _per se_, but is intended as the means for the student to shape their final assessment by the professor. In other words, it allows you to put your work into perspective.&#x20;

The goal of the Process Letter is for you to make an argument primarily for participation but also for your overall grade that you will propose for yourself. I provide here some of the guiding questions that should be taken into account to provide evidence/ justification for your suggested grade.&#x20;

* Discuss your process as a learner: evaluate your engagement with course content by reflecting on how you handled all aspects of this course. What specific parts of your process worked and what parts would benefit from some adjustments? Why?&#x20;
* Discuss the products you generated as demonstrations of your learning: evaluate how your work has changed across the semester. Did certain elements improve more than others? Did certain elements become easier or more challenging? Describe.&#x20;
* What will you do with this knowledge in future semesters? Make a commitment to yourself.
* What have you learned about yourself—as a learner and a member of a learning community—in this course?
