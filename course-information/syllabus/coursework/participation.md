# Participation

Our plan is to give students a wide variety of opportunities to actively participate in the course:

* Annotation and commenting on Perusall. Students are asked to read, comment on and reflect on the assigned readings via Perusall.
* Discussing readings during seminar
* Q+A periods during class time: students are encouraged to add questions/comments throughout discussions
* Small group breakout sessions during class&#x20;
* Discussions with professor during office hours



If the professor assesses that a student has consistently (i.e. in every class) participated at an exceptional level throughout the term, the professors may decide to reward bonus marks, above what the student has self-assessed.
