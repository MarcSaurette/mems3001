# Reading

Students will be responsible for diligently and carefully reading the assigned texts.

Readings will be available via the online social annotation site, [Perusall](https://www.perusall.com/). You will need to sign up for an account if you have not previously. Instructions are available on the website, [https://marc-saurette.gitbook.io/mems-3001/course-information/digital-tools/perusall](https://marc-saurette.gitbook.io/mems-3001/course-information/digital-tools/perusall). To access the course readings, after you have created an account, use the course code: **SAURETTE-YVEPD** on Perusall. \\

You will not need to purchase any textbooks for this class.&#x20;

#### Social Annotation

Social annotation takes the usually solitary act of reading and allows students to do it in community with one another. By using digital tools to highlight, comment, or otherwise annotate a text, students “do the reading,” but do so in conversation with their peers. Social annotation is an age-old process that is very medieval. What is different is speed. It would take centuries for texts to accrue a surrounding commentary, but we can do it online in real time in a very short span. Commentary (medieval or modern) can link to other media, can define key terms, provide further details or contradict the main text. We are, in essence, crowdsourcing (you being the crowd) the readings to allow you to deepen and expand your knowledge.&#x20;

Perusall allows us to organize all our readings in one place so that we can annotate them together. Hypothes.is allows us to do this for websites. We can use your annotation and commentary to highlight areas of confusion and disagreement and explore debates (amongst yourselves and in the field). You can use annotations to ask questions or answer them for your fellow students. They key is that we can do it together.&#x20;
