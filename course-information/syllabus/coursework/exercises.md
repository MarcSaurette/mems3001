# Exercises

The bulk of the work for class will consist of weekly exercises that we will usually begin in class (and are described on the course website). Sometimes you will need to complete preliminary work in advance of class.&#x20;

Exercise explanations and instructions can be found [here](../../exercises.md). Exercise 1 can be found [here](../../exercises/folio-measurements.md) or navigated via the sidebar under, "Exercises". We will begin our work on exercise 1 in class on January 19th. &#x20;

I will usually provide some explanation and an initial introduction to the exercise, but much of the work will need to be completed on the student’s own time. Students will be expected to complete specific tasks around manuscript analysis and measurements, finish certain number of annotations, using digital tools and the such.&#x20;

These exercises revolve around getting to understand a particular medieval text in Carleton’s collections. Each week students will work progressively to analyze and reproduce aspects of the folio they have chosen to work on. By the end of term, students will create a facsimile (as best we can), of their folio and be able to describe what it is, what is says and why we should care about it.
