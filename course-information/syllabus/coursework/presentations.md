# Presentations

In week 9 (March 9th, 2023), students will make a 10 minute polished presentation on their work so far this term, showcasing their findings on the folio they have worked on, as well as presenting their facsimile. The goal is neither to have a perfect understanding of the folio nor create a picture-perfect reproduction, but instead to note unexpected discoveries, as well as challenges and failure â€“ and what you learned from them. Your presentation should offer a reflection on your research and creative process, and as such, should focus less on the conclusions/outcome than the working towards them.&#x20;

The professor will provide a template for describing medieval folios to guide your presentation/ preparatory work.
