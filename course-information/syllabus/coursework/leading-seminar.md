# Leading Seminar

Once during the term, each student will be responsible for leading the seminar. This is a formal activity in which the student takes on the role of the discussion leader. Discussion leaders must read the assigned readings in advance of their chosen week in advance, and by the Friday of the week before (i.e. 6 days before the seminar to be led) must post guiding questions to Teams to help focus the reading for other students. Each seminar will begin with the student-leader introducing the readings, raising and gathering interesting or perplexing issues from each of the other students/ or as noted on Perusall. A good presenter will evidence an ability to contextualize the readings knowledgeably, and to note or critique the theoretical stance (if applicable). The goal is to facilitate discussion, so avoid lecturing.
