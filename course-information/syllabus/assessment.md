# Assessment

Due to the experiential nature of this class, many aspects of the course cannot be assessed using traditional scholarly grades. Instead, we will be using a simplified form of assessment for this class. All work will be assessed as either Unsatisfactory, Satisfactory or Excellent. If all your work is assessed as **Satisfactory**, you will receive a B. If all your work is assessed as **Excellent**, you will receive an A+. If you receive a mixture of these two, your grade will fall somewhere in the middle. Work deemed **unsatisfactory** (F) can be reworked and submitted for reassessment until deemed satisfactory. Participation will be self-assessed.&#x20;

Your final mark will be assessed based on your completion of the following coursework:

| **Assignment Type**           | **Relative Weight** |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Reading & Annotations         | 15%                 |
| Participation (self assessed) | 25%                 |
| Leading Seminar               | 10%                 |
| Exercises                     | 25%                 |
| Presentations                 | 10%                 |
| Final Project                 | 15%                 |
