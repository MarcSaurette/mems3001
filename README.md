# Welcome

When we say that we “scroll” through a webpage or use the abbreviation “@” as part of an email address, we evoke ghosts of textual cultures flourishing before the rise of printed books. When we skim through a book’s table of contents and its index to read efficiently or we wonder how to use the semi-colon properly, we are drawing on medieval textual innovations that remain in use today. Not only does manuscript culture live on in contemporary books and thinking, but medieval manuscripts themselves are taking on a new life – in growing online collections that grant us access to a library of medieval texts larger than anything possible in the Middle Ages.&#x20;

This course will be run as a seminar where students have hands-on experience with medieval evidence. We will spend time in Carleton’s Archives and Special Collections, and understand how medieval manuscripts/ early modern printed books are made in our Book Arts lab.
