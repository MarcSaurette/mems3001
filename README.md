# Welcome

Our society produces images of the Middle Ages as both a simpler and a more exciting time – of brave knights, beautiful princesses and maybe of vicious warfare or dragons to spice it up. But the Middle Ages were so much more diverse, rich and weird than any movie, TV show or video game depicts. This course invites you to uncover the real and hidden worlds of the Middle Ages.

This course will be run as a seminar where students have hands-on experience with medieval evidence – medieval manuscripts as well as explore medieval manuscripts online. We will spend time in Carleton’s Archives and Special Collections, and understand how medieval manuscripts/ early modern printed books are made in our Book Arts lab.
