# Orientation

We will meet to discuss the class and make clear expectations for the term. We will also try to get any and all programs working which we will be using this term.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a laptop, bring it to class so that we can set up key digital tools we will be using in class together. Some are a bit touchy to set up , so its best to do it together.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Goals:&#x20;

* meet and get to know one another
* understand course work in terms of the goals of the course
* set up necessary digital tools
* try our hand at making a quill pen

### Practice

1. We will ensure that everyone has the following programs/ sites up and running:

* [Teams](../course-information/digital-tools/teams.md)
* Perusall

2\. We will attempt to complete our first exercise, to cut a quill pen from feathers.&#x20;

### To do after class:

* Read the syllabus (i.e. this website) to get a sense of how it works and what the expectations are;
* Do any prepatory reading and complete your annotations in advance of [next week's class](meetings-with-manuscripts.md), which will take place in the Archives and Research Collection space on the fifth-floor of Paterson.&#x20;
