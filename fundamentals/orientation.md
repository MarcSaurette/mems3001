# Orientation

We will meet to discuss the class and make clear expectations for the term. We will also try to get any and all programs working which we will be using this term.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a laptop, bring it to class so that we can set up key digital tools we will be using in class together. Some are a bit touchy to set up , so its best to do it together.&#x20;
