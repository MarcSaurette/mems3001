# Mise-en-Page

This week we will meet in the Book Arts Lab.

### Goals

* in the first part of class, we will discuss the terminology and norms of medieval _mis-en-page_; we will seek to answer how medieval techniques and materials encouraged organizing information in specific ways. &#x20;
* In the second part of class, we will use the measurements taken last week in class and use them to layout a hand drawn facsimile on paper. This marks the first step in creating a reproduction of the medieval manuscript.

### Read/Watch/Listen

### Practice

We will start the [Reproducing the Ruling](../course-information/exercises/reproducing-the-ruling.md) exercise in class. If incomplete by the end of class, finish your work before next class. All work will be left in the Book Arts Lab and you can arrange with Larry to have access to it outside of class time.&#x20;
