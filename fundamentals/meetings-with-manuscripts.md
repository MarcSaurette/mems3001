# Meetings with Manuscripts

This week we will meet in the Archives and Special Collections room, on the fifth floor in MacOdrum Library, to look at the medieval manuscripts and early printed books in Carleton's Collection.

### Goals

* Discuss and understand the history of the book and the changing technologies of reading and book production during the medieval period and early modern period
* Understand this history by looking hands-on at examples of medieval and early print books
* Students begin to document/ catalogue an example from Carleton's collection of medieval material

### Read/Watch/Listen

Read James Raven, _The Oxford Illustrated History Of The Book._ Oxford: Oxford University Press (2020): chapters 3, 5 and 8. Readings posted on Perusall.&#x20;

### Practice

Complete the [folio measurements exercise](../course-information/exercises/folio-measurements.md) in class. Your measurements should be organized into a diagram or list of detailed measurements. A copy of this needs to be submitted to me on paper at the start of next class - either a printed list or printed scan of your handwritten work.&#x20;
